== Disclaimer

* The purpose here is to discuss a bit about how I approach architecture
* I haven't put in the effort to weigh competing technology between cloud providers
* I've done no performance or cost analysis

=== My Approach to Architecture

[%step]
* Is about designing how technology and people work together to achieve business goals
* Is like pruning a hedge
* Is iterative

=== Steps

[%step]
1. Figure out where we want to be (business goals, product discovery, tech-debt)
2. Figure out where we are now (people and code)
3. Make a change
4. Repeat
