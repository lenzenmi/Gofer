== Disclaimer

* The purpose here is to discuss a bit about how I approach architecture
* I haven't put in the effort to weigh competing technology between cloud providers
* I've done no performance or cost analysis

== Systems Architecture

I believe that architecture is about designing a system comprised of people and technology to achieve business goals.
It's not just about drawing boxes and lines and reading technical specifications.

== Approach

* It's like pruning a hedge. 
* It's iterative.
* We can only ever know the architecture we wish we had now. 

== Approach cont...

1. Figure out where we are now (people and code)
2. Figure out where we want to be (business goals, product discovery, tech-debt)
3. Make a change
4. Repeat
