# 2. web stack
======

Date: 16-09-2023 11:29:39

## Status
======

Proposed

## Context
======

* The majority of user interactions will be done after login with displayed information being
specific to the logged in user
* We have already selected React for our mobile app development
* We are looking to move fast to build a proof of concept
* React is a popular web framework in use today

## Decision
======

We choose a React/TypeScript stack for our web stack


## Consequences
======

Pros:
* Will allow us to hire experienced developers
* Developers will be able to move between the web and mobile project gaining
efficiency in resource usage
* There are many libraries and mature tooling which can help accelerate the project

Cons:
* Will be difficult to expand the organization going forward. Future effort will be needed
to allow more than a few developers to work on the project efficiently
