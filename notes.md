Product Gofer

Context:
Gofer is a peer to peer personal shopper market place.
Which aims to reduce our Carbon footprint.

You can think of it as a combination of Insta-Cart and Car Pooling.
The main concept, is that when you need few items from a store, you would
choose to have someone already at the store pick the item up for you and deliver
it to you on their way home. Shoppers are rewarded a delivery fee in exchange for their services.

# Major Problems to solve:
## Trust
  * We will record driver location to ensure that they begin at the pickup location and stop at the 
  final destination. These will be persisted for auditing and fraud prevention
  * Drivers upload pictures of the purchase receipt in-case of dispute
  * Drivers will be identified using a third party identity verification service
  * Users mark when the goods are received and funds are released
